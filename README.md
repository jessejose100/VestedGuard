VestedGuard: Secure Token & Escrow Protocol
===========================================

Overview
--------

VestedGuard is a sophisticated Stacks blockchain smart contract that provides advanced token management, secure escrow services, and intelligent vesting functionality. Designed for projects requiring controlled token distribution and secure transactions, this contract offers robust features for token holders and project administrators.

Features
--------

### 1\. Standard Token Functionality

-   Token Name: VestedToken (VST)
-   Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 tokens
-   Basic token transfer and balance management
-   Owner-controlled minting capabilities

### 2\. Escrow Services

-   Create secure escrow transactions
-   Complete or cancel escrow agreements
-   Prevent unauthorized access to escrow funds
-   Granular control over transaction completion

### 3\. Vesting Schedule Management

-   Time-based token distribution
-   Configurable vesting periods
-   Precise token release mechanism
-   Claim-based token distribution

Contract Functions
------------------

### Token Management

-   `transfer(recipient, amount)`: Transfer tokens between addresses
-   `mint(recipient, amount)`: Mint new tokens (owner-only)
-   `get-balance(owner)`: Check token balance

### Escrow Functions

-   `create-escrow(receiver, amount)`: Initiate an escrow transaction
-   `complete-escrow(escrow-id)`: Finalize an escrow transaction
-   `cancel-escrow(escrow-id)`: Cancel an ongoing escrow

### Vesting Functions

-   `create-vesting(recipient, start-block, end-block, total-amount)`: Create a vesting schedule
-   `claim-vested-tokens(vesting-id)`: Claim tokens according to vesting schedule

Error Handling
--------------

The contract includes comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:

-   Authorization errors
-   Insufficient balance errors
-   Escrow-related errors
-   Vesting-related errors

Security Considerations
-----------------------

-   Owner-only minting and vesting creation
-   Block-height based vesting calculation
-   Strict balance and authorization checks
-   Immutable contract owner

Usage Example
-------------

### Creating a Vesting Schedule

```
(create-vesting
  'recipient-address
  block-start
  block-end
  total-vesting-amount
)

```

### Claiming Vested Tokens

```
(claim-vested-tokens vesting-id)

```

Deployment Considerations
-------------------------

-   Deployed on the Stacks blockchain
-   Requires careful configuration of vesting schedules
-   Recommended for projects with complex token distribution needs
